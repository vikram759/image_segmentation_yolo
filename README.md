# Image Segmentation using YOLOv8

## Project Overview
This project focuses on image segmentation using the YOLOv8 deep learning model. It involves preparing and annotating a custom image dataset, training and fine-tuning the model, and evaluating its performance on a test set.

## Key Features
- Preparation of a custom dataset annotated and converted into YOLOv8-compatible text format.
- Training and fine-tuning a YOLOv8 model to achieve high accuracy.
- Evaluating the model using metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP), precision, recall, and F1-score.
- Validating predictions and the end-to-end object detection pipeline on test images.

## Results
- Achieved a mean Average Precision (mAP) of 99.0% on the validation dataset.
- Performance metrics confirm the robustness and accuracy of the trained model.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
git clone <repository-url>


2. Install required dependencies (Python 3.8+ recommended):
pip install -r requirements.txt


(Includes Ultralytics YOLOv8, OpenCV, and other necessary libraries)

## Usage
- Annotate your images using any compatible labeling tool.
- Convert labels to YOLOv8 text format for training.
- Train the YOLOv8 model with:


- Evaluate the model:=


- Test predictions on new images and utilize evaluation metrics:


## Evaluation Metrics
- **mAP (mean Average Precision)**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1-score**

These metrics help ensure the model's predictions are both precise and comprehensive.
